        in a small bowl

    b.  Whisk together 2 tsp. of baking powder and ½ tsp. of sea salt in
        a large bowl

    c.  Mix the small bowl of liquid into the larger bowl

> **Note:** Only whisk until lumps are gone. Do not overmix.

2.  Mix 3 tbsp. of margarine with 5 tbsp. of brown sugar and 2 tsp. of
    cinnamon in a small bowl. Put substance into pastry bag after
    mixing.

3.  Set the stove to just over medium heat. Grease the skillet with the
    vegetable oil.

> **Caution:** My stove gets hot quickly and may become hotter than
> other stoves. For this reason, you can leave the heat at medium and
> increase temperature is needed.

4.  Pour the batter and the substance in the pastry bag into the
    skillet.

    a.  Once hot, use a measuring cup to pour ¼ cup of batter into the
        skillet.

    b.  Squeeze out the brown sugar mix from the pastry bag in a
        swirling motion on top of the pancake batter until you reach the
        edge of the pancake.

5.  When the pancake begins to bubble use the spatula to flip it onto
    the other side.

> **Note:** Bubbling should happen within 3-4 minutes.

6.  Allow pancake to cook on the other side for 1 minute, or until light
    brown. Follow the same steps until the batter is gone.

> **Note:** Do not forget to apply more vegetable oil as needed.

7.  Make the glaze.

    a.  Mix 2 cups of powdered sugar and ¼ cup of water. Whisk
        thoroughly.

    b.  Pour onto cooked pancakes
